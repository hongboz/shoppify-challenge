    "a. The biggest issue with calculating the average order value is that the number of shoes in each order can vary drastically and affect our AOV. We see that there was at least 1 customer who ordered 2000 shoes in 1 order and that the average number of shoes sold per order is 8.8. This means that our AOV of \\\\$3145 roughly indicates the cost of 9 pairs of shoes which would mean that the average pair of shoes would cost around \\\\$349. This is much better than the AOV, but I feel like it could be better as common sense and skimming through the data would tell you that \\$349 is still a bit too high."
